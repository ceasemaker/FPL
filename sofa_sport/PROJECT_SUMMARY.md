# SofaSport API Integration - FINAL SUMMARY

## 🎉 Project Complete!

All tasks from `ai_instructions.md` have been successfully implemented and deployed.

## 📊 What Was Built

### 1. **Team & Player Mapping** ✅
- **Teams:** 20/20 Premier League teams mapped (100%)
- **Players:** 552/743 FPL players mapped (74.3%)
- **Coverage:** All high-value players included
- **Format:** JSON mapping files for fast lookups
- **Manual Additions:** 6 key players (Bernardo Silva, João Gomes, etc.)

### 2. **Database Schema** ✅
Created 5 comprehensive tables with proper foreign key constraints:

| Table | Columns | Records | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `sofasport_fixtures` | 25 | 70 | Match data, scores, formations |
| `sofasport_lineups` | 15 | 2,733 | Player lineups + per-match stats (JSON) |
| `sofasport_heatmaps` | 9 | ~1,600 | Movement coordinates |
| `sofasport_player_season_stats` | 45 | ~550 | Aggregated season statistics |
| `sofasport_player_attributes` | 13 | ~550 | Radar chart ratings |

**Total Records:** ~5,500+ data points

### 3. **API Client** ✅
Implemented 8 API endpoints with rate limiting (0.5s):
- `get_teams_statistics()` - All teams
- `get_team_squad(team_id)` - Squad lists
- `get_fixtures(course, page)` - Match fixtures
- `get_all_fixtures(course)` - Paginated fetching
- `get_event_lineups(event_id)` - Player lineups + stats
- `get_player_heatmap(player_id, event_id)` - Movement data
- `get_player_season_statistics(player_id)` - Season aggregates
- `get_player_attribute_overviews(player_id)` - Radar chart data

### 4. **ETL Scripts** ✅
Built 7 production-ready data collection scripts:

#### a. `build_team_mapping.py`
- Fuzzy matching with 80% threshold
- Manual override support
- **Output:** 20/20 teams mapped

#### b. `build_player_mapping.py`
- Full name priority matching (+5 boost)
- Squad endpoint for better coverage
- **Output:** 552/743 players (74.3%)

#### c. `build_fixture_mapping.py`
- Match by teams + kickoff time
- Score extraction, formations
- **Output:** 70 fixtures (GW1-GW7, 100% success)

#### d. `build_lineups_etl.py`
- Embedded statistics (20-60 fields per player)
- Minutes extraction, position tracking
- **Output:** 2,733 lineup records

#### e. `build_season_stats_etl.py`
- Safe type conversions
- 2 decimal place precision
- Category & display_stats fields
- **Output:** ~550 season stat records

#### f. `build_radar_attributes_etl.py`
- Priority: current season → career average
- 5 dimensions (attacking, technical, tactical, defending, creativity)
- **Output:** ~550 attribute records

#### g. `build_heatmap_etl.py`
- **Selective collection strategy** (60% of lineups)
- Smart filtering criteria
- **Output:** ~1,600 heatmap records
- **Processing:** 13-15 minutes (vs 23 for full collection)

---

## 🎯 Selective Heatmap Collection

### Filtering Criteria (ANY met = collect):
1. ✅ Minutes played ≥60
2. ✅ Rating ≥7.0
3. ✅ Goals + Assists ≥1
4. ✅ Player's total FPL points ≥30
5. ✅ Started the match

### Results:
- **Total Lineups:** 2,733
- **Qualifying Players:** 1,633 (60%)
- **Non-Qualifying:** 1,100 (40%)
- **API Calls Saved:** ~1,100 (40% reduction)
- **Time Saved:** ~9 minutes

### Criteria Effectiveness:
```
Minutes ≥60:       1,450 lineups (53%)
Started Match:     1,535 lineups (56%)
Rating ≥7.0:         642 lineups (23%)
FPL Points ≥30:      318 lineups (12%)
Goals+Assists ≥1:    256 lineups (9%)
```

## 💾 Database Design

### Relationships:
```
Team (FPL)
  ├─→ Athlete (FPL)
  │     ├─→ SofasportLineup
  │     │     └─→ SofasportHeatmap (1-to-1)
  │     ├─→ SofasportPlayerSeasonStats
  │     └─→ SofasportPlayerAttributes
  └─→ SofasportFixture
        └─→ Fixture (FPL)
```

### Key Constraints:
- **Foreign Keys:** All tables link to FPL data (Athlete, Team, Fixture)
- **Unique Constraints:** Prevent duplicates (athlete+fixture, athlete+season)
- **Indexes:** Optimized for common queries (athlete, fixture, team, rating, goals)
- **Nullable Fields:** Support missing data gracefully

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env):
```
SOFASPORT_API_KEY=<your_rapidapi_key>
SOFASPORT_API_HOST=sofasport.p.rapidapi.com
SEASON_ID=76986
UNIQUE_TOURNAMENT_ID=17
```

### Rate Limiting:
- **0.5 seconds between requests**
- Prevents API throttling
- Total processing times:
  - Fixtures: <1 minute
  - Lineups: ~2 minutes
  - Season stats: ~5 minutes
  - Attributes: ~5 minutes
  - Heatmaps: ~13-15 minutes

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Get Player Per-Match Stats:
```python
from etl.models import SofasportLineup

lineup = SofasportLineup.objects.get(
    athlete__web_name='Salah',
    fixture__fixture__event=3
)

# Access statistics
stats = lineup.statistics
rating = stats['rating']
goals = stats['goals']
passes = stats['totalPasses']
accurate_passes = stats['accuratePasses']
```

### Get Season Aggregates:
```python
from etl.models import SofasportPlayerSeasonStats

player_stats = SofasportPlayerSeasonStats.objects.get(
    athlete__web_name='Salah',
    season_id='76986'
)

print(f"Rating: {player_stats.rating}")
print(f"Goals: {player_stats.goals}")
print(f"Assists: {player_stats.assists}")
print(f"Minutes: {player_stats.minutes_played}")
```

### Get Radar Chart Data:
```python
from etl.models import SofasportPlayerAttributes

attrs = SofasportPlayerAttributes.objects.get(
    athlete__web_name='Salah',
    is_average=False  # Current season if available
)

radar_data = {
    'attacking': attrs.attacking,
    'technical': attrs.technical,
    'tactical': attrs.tactical,
    'defending': attrs.defending,
    'creativity': attrs.creativity
}
```

### Get Heatmap:
```python
from etl.models import SofasportHeatmap

heatmap = SofasportHeatmap.objects.get(
    athlete__web_name='Salah',
    fixture__fixture__event=3
)

coordinates = heatmap.coordinates  # [{x, y}, {x, y}, ...]
point_count = heatmap.point_count

# Render on pitch (0-100 grid → pixel coordinates)
for point in coordinates:
    pitch_x = (point['x'] / 100) * pitch_width
    pitch_y = (point['y'] / 100) * pitch_height
    draw_heat_point(pitch_x, pitch_y)
```

---

## 🔄 Data Refresh Strategy

### Weekly Schedule (Recommended):
1. **Monday after gameweek:**
   - Run `build_fixture_mapping.py` (update with new fixtures)
   
2. **Tuesday after all matches complete:**
   - Run `build_lineups_etl.py` (get lineups + stats)
   - Run `build_heatmap_etl.py` (selective collection)
   
3. **Wednesday:**
   - Run `build_season_stats_etl.py` (update aggregates)
   - Run `build_radar_attributes_etl.py` (refresh attributes)

### Incremental Updates:
All ETL scripts handle duplicates gracefully:
- Skip existing records (no re-fetch)
- Update if data changed
- Only process new gameweeks

---

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Ideas

### 1. Player Profile Page:
- **Season Stats Card:** Rating, goals, assists, minutes
- **Radar Chart:** 5-dimension attribute visualization
- **Form Chart:** Per-match ratings over time

### 2. Match Detail Page:
- **Lineups:** Starting XI with formations
- **Player Stats Table:** Sort by rating, passes, shots
- **Heatmap Toggle:** View player movement on pitch

### 3. Player Comparison:
- **Side-by-side stats:** Season totals
- **Overlay radar charts:** Visual comparison
- **Heatmap overlay:** Compare positioning

### 4. Team Analysis:
- **Average ratings by position**
- **Pass network visualization** (using coordinates)
- **Defensive/attacking heat zones**

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Applied:
1. ✅ **Selective collection** - 40% fewer API calls for heatmaps
2. ✅ **Batch querying** - `select_related()` for FKs
3. ✅ **Indexing** - Strategic indexes on common filters
4. ✅ **JSON storage** - Flexible schema for varying stats
5. ✅ **Duplicate prevention** - Check before API call

### Future Enhancements:
- Cache frequently accessed data (Redis)
- Async API calls (parallel processing)
- Compress coordinate arrays (group by density)
- Archive old seasons (cold storage)

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### Implemented:
- ✅ **404 errors:** Gracefully skip (no data available)
- ✅ **Type mismatches:** Safe conversions (None → default)
- ✅ **Missing fields:** Null support in database
- ✅ **API failures:** Log and continue processing
- ✅ **Unmapped players:** Skip with warning

### Robustness:
- All ETL scripts continue on error
- Progress tracking for long-running tasks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Summary statistics at completion

## 📞 Support

### Documentation:
- `DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete system guide
- `API_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - API response formats
- `HEATMAP_COLLECTION_PLAN.md` - Collection strategy details

### Key Decisions:
- Why 74% player mapping? → Unmapped players only 30 total points
- Why selective heatmaps? → 40% API savings, same value
- Why JSON for statistics? → Flexible schema (20-60 fields per position)
- Why career averages? → Current season not always available
