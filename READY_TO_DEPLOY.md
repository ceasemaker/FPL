## ðŸŽ¯ Deploy Now (5 Steps)

### **Step 1: Commit & Push**

# Review changes
git status

# Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Add radar charts, player comparison, Celery scheduling, and Render production config"

# Push to GitHub

### **Step 2: Update Django Web Service in Render**

Go to: **Render Dashboard â†’ Your Django Web Service**

#### **Build Command** (update to):
```bash
./build.sh
```

#### **Start Command** (update to):
```bash
./start-prod.sh
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Environment Variables**

In your Django Web Service, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Required - Get your RapidAPI key
RAPIDAPI_KEY=<your-rapidapi-key>
RAPIDAPI_HOST=sofasport.p.rapidapi.com

# Required - Your frontend URL for CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<your-frontend>.onrender.com

# Auto-populated by Render (verify they're set)
DATABASE_URL=<should-already-be-set>
REDIS_URL=<should-already-be-set>

# Optional (recommended)
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<generate-new-one>
DEBUG=false
TZ=Europe/London
C_FORCE_ROOT=true
```

**Generate secret key:**
```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy**

In Render Dashboard:
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** â†’ **"Deploy latest commit"**
2. Watch the build logs
3. Wait for "Live" status

---

### **Step 5: Verify It Works**

#### **Check Logs:**
Look for these lines in your web service logs:
```
âœ… Build completed successfully!
INFO spawned: 'gunicorn' with pid xxx
INFO spawned: 'celery-worker' with pid xxx
INFO spawned: 'celery-beat' with pid xxx
gunicorn: Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
celery@hostname ready.
celerybeat: Starting...
```

#### **Test API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Replace YOUR_SERVICE with your actual service name

# Basic API
curl https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/players/ | head

# Radar chart (Saka)
curl https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/sofasport/player/16/radar/

# Compare players
curl 'https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/sofasport/compare/radar/?player_ids=16,23'
```

#### **Test Frontend:**
1. Open your frontend URL
2. Go to Players page
3. Click any player â†’ Radar chart should appear in modal! ðŸŽ‰
4. Select 2 players â†’ Click Compare â†’ Overlapping radar charts! ðŸŽ¨

---

## ðŸ“… Automated Schedule (Daily Updates)

Your Celery Beat will run these tasks automatically:

| Day | Time | Task |
|-----|------|------|
| Monday | 2 AM GMT | Update fixture mappings |
| Tuesday | 3 AM GMT | Update lineups |
| Tuesday | 4 AM GMT | Collect heatmaps |
| Wednesday | 2 AM GMT | Update season stats |
| Wednesday | 3 AM GMT | **Update radar attributes** |

**No manual intervention needed!**

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails:
- Check `build.sh` is in root directory
- Verify `django_etl/requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### Service Won't Start:
- Check `start-prod.sh` is executable (it is)
- Verify `supervisord.conf` is in root directory (it is)

### Celery Not Starting:
- Verify `REDIS_URL` is set correctly
- Check it's the **Internal Redis URL**, not external

### CORS Errors:
- Verify `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` matches your frontend URL exactly
- Format: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com` (no trailing slash)

### No Radar Data:
- Verify `RAPIDAPI_KEY` is set correctly
- Check you have credits on RapidAPI
- Some players don't have SofaSport data (this is normal)

---

## ðŸ’° Cost Reminder

**NO ADDITIONAL COSTS!**
- Using your existing Django web service
- Using your existing PostgreSQL
- Using your existing Redis
- Using your existing Frontend service

**Everything runs in the same services you're already paying for.**
