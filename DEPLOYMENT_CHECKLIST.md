- [ ] Update Build Command
- [ ] Update Start Command  
- [ ] Add/Update Environment Variables
- [ ] Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
- [ ] Watch build logs
- [ ] Look for "‚úÖ Build completed successfully!"
- [ ] Wait for service to start

### Step 4: Verify Services Started
Look for these in logs:
- [ ] `gunicorn: Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000`
- [ ] `celery@... ready.`
- [ ] `celerybeat: Starting...`

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Deployment Verification ‚úÖ

### Test API Endpoints:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_SERVICE with your service name

# Basic API
curl https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/players/ | head -20

# Radar chart
curl https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/sofasport/player/16/radar/

# Compare players
curl 'https://YOUR_SERVICE.onrender.com/api/sofasport/compare/radar/?player_ids=16,23'
```

Expected:
- [ ] All endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Radar endpoint returns JSON with attributes
- [ ] Compare endpoint returns multiple players

### Test Frontend:

1. Open your frontend URL
2. **Players Page:**
   - [ ] Players list loads
   - [ ] Can search/filter players
3. **Player Modal:**

   - [ ] Comparison page opens
   - [ ] Radar charts overlap correctly
   - [ ] Legend shows player names
   - [ ] Stats table displays

### Check Celery:

- [ ] In Render logs, search for "celery-worker"
- [ ] Should see: "ready" message
- [ ] In logs, search for "celery-beat"  
- [ ] Should see: "Starting..." message
- [ ] Verify scheduled tasks listed

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Common Issues & Quick Fixes üîß

### "Build failed" ‚ùå

- **Check:** Are dependencies in `django_etl/requirements.txt`?
- **Fix:** Review build logs for specific error

### "Service won't start" ‚ùå
- **Check:** Is `start-prod.sh` executable?
- **Check:** Is `supervisord.conf` in correct location?
- **Fix:** Check Start Command in Render dashboard

### "Database connection error" ‚ùå
- **Check:** Is `DATABASE_URL` set?

### "Celery not starting" ‚ùå
- **Check:** Is `REDIS_URL` set?
- **Check:** Is Redis connected to web service?
- **Fix:** Look for "celery" errors in logs

### "CORS error on frontend" ‚ùå
